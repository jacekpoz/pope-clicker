Pope Clicker is my first real game and first real project, this version is developed in [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).
Versions <0.7 were made in [FXGL](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL), and you can find them [here](https://github.com/jacekpoz/pope-clicker-fxgl).

The whole game is meant as a joke, it's not meant to offend anyone, but if you think something I add is too much, feel free to tell me.

The game is very simple right now, I'll be adding more things later on. If you have any ideas or art to submit, please do so at the issues tab.
